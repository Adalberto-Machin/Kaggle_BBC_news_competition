# this is the python util file where I will create my different classes

# import all necessary libraries


# create a class for the training of the different models with the structure below:

# 1 Main class where the model data is loaded appropriately
    # 1a Method of the main class where the model is tokenized
#2 Sub-Class where we do the training of the unsupervised model
    # 2a Method where any ensemble methods, improvements are made to the model training
#3 Method where we predict the test data and measure accuracy
#4 Sub-class where we do a training of the supervised model
    # 4a Method where we improve training of the supervised model
# eventually, the supervised model should use the same method we defined for the prediction in order to test its accuracy
